Reflecting on my individual contribution to the group project, I found that a significant portion of my effort was dedicated to data preprocessing. Initially, I began by searching for publicly available datasets, ensuring they were well-documented and ethically sound for our analysis. This involved scouring various sources, from open data repositories to government databases, to find datasets relevant to our project scope. Through this process, I not only enhanced my skills in data sourcing but also gained valuable insights into the ethical considerations surrounding data usage. Furthermore, I read tutorials and online resources to learn best practices for data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering. This research phase proved instrumental in shaping our data preprocessing and laying a better foundation for subsequent analysis.
