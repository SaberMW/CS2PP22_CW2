In reflecting on my individual contribution to the group project, I found it quite fulfilling but also quite tough at times. At first, I struggled with getting a new Python package to work smoothly with our project and making sure it fit in well. However, as I worked through it, I got a better grasp of how to use it effectively and how it added value to what we were doing. Working closely with my teammates helped me improve my coding skills and how I communicate, as we worked together on the different parts of the data analysis process. Overall, this experience showed me how important it is to be flexible, work well with others, and keep learning in the field of data science.
