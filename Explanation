The provided code meets the requirement of performing data pre-processing by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, which are two common manipulations in data pre-processing.

Handling Missing Values:

In the code, we first load the dataset using pd.read_csv(url, names=column_names, na_values=' ?'), where na_values=' ?' marks missing values as ' ?'.
We then check for missing values using missing_values = data.isnull().sum() to see how many missing values are in each column.
Next, we drop rows with missing values using data_cleaned = data.dropna(). This removes any rows from the dataset that contain missing values, ensuring that we have complete data to work with.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

We use one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a numerical format that the computer can understand.
The pd.get_dummies() function is used to create binary columns for each category in the specified columns (['workclass', 'education', 'marital-status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'native-country']).
This creates a new dataset, data_encoded, where each category in the original categorical columns is represented by a binary value (1 or 0) in its own column.
By combining these techniques with the provided code:

We ensure that our dataset doesn't have any missing values, which could cause errors or inaccuracies in our analysis.
We transform categorical variables into a numerical format, making it easier for machine learning algorithms to work with the data.
Overall, these steps help clean and prepare our data for further analysis or modeling, improving the quality and reliability of our results.
